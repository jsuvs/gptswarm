dm: "Bob, you see a rug on the floor and a table on the rug."

bob: "I want to search the table to see if the thimble is on it."

dm: "You see a locked box on the table but no thimble. Maybe try looking under the rug?"

bob: "Alright, I'll try to lift the rug to see if the thimble is underneath."

dm: "Roll a dexterity check to see if you can lift the rug without disturbing the key that's hidden under it."

bob: "Sure, I rolled a 17 on the dexterity check. Can I lift the rug without disturbing the key and see if the thimble is underneath?"
