bob (player) prompt: Lets play a game. You are a player named Bob. Your objective is to find a thimble. I will describe what you can see and you tell me what you want to do next in first person. 

dm: "Bob, you're in a room with a rug on the floor and a table on the rug. Look around and see if you can spot anything interesting."

bob (player): "I approach the table and look at the items on it. Do I see a thimble on the table?"

dm: "No, Bob. You don't see anything on the table but a locked box. Perhaps you should search the rug."

bob (player): "Alright, I get down on my hands and knees to search the rug. I feel around for any bumps or lumps that could suggest the thimble is hiding under there."

dm: "You do indeed feel a bump under the rug, Bob. It seems like the key to the locked box might be under there. How will you proceed?"

bob (player): "I carefully lift up the corner of the rug to find out what's under there. Can I see the key or do I need to search for it?"

dm: "You can see the key, Bob. It's hidden under the rug. Will you take the key and try unlocking the box?"

bob (player): "Yes, I will take the key and make my way to the locked box on the table. I insert the key and turn the lock in the hopes of finding the thimble inside."

dm: "You successfully unlock the box, Bob. Inside you find a thimble. Done."

bob (player): "Fantastic! I take the thimble from the box and put it in my pocket. Thank you for playing this game with me."

dm: "You're welcome, Bob. Have a great day!"

bob (player): "Thanks, you too!"

dm: "DONE."
