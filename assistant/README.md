## Voice wrapper around ChatGPT
Talk to ChatGPT down microphone and ChatGPT speaks back
Can also tell ChatGPT to talk faster (say "speed up" or "slow down")

One noticable problem is that if it provides any code in its answers then it speaks all the code out...

Requirements
- AWS account. Credentials set up with AWS CLI and with permissions to access AWS Polly and Transcribe services
- OpenAI API access. Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
- A bunch of python libraries need to be imported

I'll tidy this up when I have time
