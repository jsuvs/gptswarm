*Voice to text wrapper around ChatGPT*
Can be used to talk to ChatGPT down the microphone and ChatGPT speaks back through the speaker.
Can tell ChatGPT to talk faster (say "speed up" or "slow down")

Requirements
- AWS account. Credentials set up with AWS CLI and with permissions to access AWS Polly and Transcribe services
- OpenAI API access. Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
- A bunch of python libraries need to be imported

I'll tidy this up when I have time
